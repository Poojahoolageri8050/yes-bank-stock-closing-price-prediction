 capstone project(yes Bank)
Summary:
In this project, exploratory data analysis, visualization, regression models with different types and interesting insights of the data have been performed. This dataset has around 185 observations in it with 5 columns. Fundamental Analysis involves analyzing the company’s future profitability on the basis of its current business environment and financial performance. Technical Analysis, on the other hand, includes reading the charts and using statistical figures to identify the trends in the stock market. The will be on the technical analysis part.


Objective:

Yes Bank is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain. Since 2018, it has been in the news because of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor. Owing to this fact, it was interesting to see how that impacted the stock prices of the company and whether Time series models or any other predictive models can do justice to such situations. This dataset has monthly stock prices of the bank since its inception and includes closing, starting, highest, and lowest stock prices of every month. The main objective is to predict the stock’s closing price of the month.

Introduction:

Yes Bank is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain. It has been in the headlines since 2018  as a result of the Rana kapoor fraud case. Due to this, it was interesting to observe how it affected the  company's stock prices and whether Time series models or other prediction models could properly  reflect for such circumstances. Since the bank's founding, this dataset has included closing, starting,  highest, and lowest stock prices for each month.Predicting how the stock market will perform is one of the most difficult things to do. There are so many factors involved in the prediction – physical factors vs. psychological, rational and irrational behavior, etc. All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
After data cleaning it was sure to target some important columns for Exploratory Data Analysis. Matching the data with correct suitable problem by python libraries to result some insightful visualization was great task. These also gives us a more information and graphs.


Approach:
As a first step, the data as loaded the data and mounted the drive. After mounting the drive, important libraries such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib and also all regressions model libraries with their metrics were imported, which are useful for our analysis.

Exploration our data was performed by checking all the necessary parameters like shape, head, tail, information of the columns and their datatypes and description of data like mean, min and max. Exploratory data analysis, normalization, lag creation, preparation of the data and two types of splits were performed.

Finally, the data was fit using various supervised regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Ridge and Lasso Techniques, Random Forest and Decision Tree Regression. All the performance metrics of these models were compared against each other and the best model was used to predict the stock price.

Result:
The popularity of stock closing is growing extremely rapidly day by day which encourage researcher to find new methods if any fraud happens
•	This technique is used for prediction is not only helpful to researchers to predict future stock closing prices or any fraud happen or not but also helps investors or any person who dealing with the stock market in order to prediction of model with good accuracy.
•	In this work we use linear regression technique, lasso regression, ridge regression, Decision Tree Regression technique these four models gives us the following results.
•	High, low, open are directly correlate with the closing price of stocks.
•	Target variable (dependent variable) strongly dependent on independent variables.
